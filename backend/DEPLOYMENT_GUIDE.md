# Car Scraper Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Selenium WebDriver Dependency
**Problem**: The original scraper used Selenium with Chrome WebDriver, which requires Chrome to be installed on the server.

**Solution**: Replaced Selenium with `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping. This approach:
- Works on any server without browser dependencies
- Is faster and more reliable
- Uses less memory and CPU
- Has better error handling

### 2. Missing Error Handling
**Problem**: No proper error handling or logging for debugging deployment issues.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling:
- Request retries with exponential backoff
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful error responses
- Timeout handling

### 3. Response Format Issues
**Problem**: Frontend expected a simple array but backend might return different formats.

**Solution**: Updated both frontend and backend to handle multiple response formats and provide better error messages.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Your Render Deployment

1. **Push the updated code** to your repository
2. **Redeploy** your Render service
3. **Check the logs** in Render dashboard for any errors

### 2. Verify Deployment

Test your API endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-render-url.onrender.com/

# Search test
curl "https://your-render-url.onrender.com/search?q=Toyota"
```

### 3. Monitor Logs

In Render dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Click on "Logs" tab
3. Look for any error messages or warnings

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting Timeouts

1. **Check Render Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Test Locally**: Run `python test_scraper.py` to verify scraper works
3. **Reduce max_pages**: Try with `max_pages=1` first
4. **Check Network**: Ensure the car websites are accessible

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limiting**: The scraper now includes delays between requests
2. **Website Changes**: Car websites might have changed their HTML structure
3. **Render Free Tier Limits**: Free tier has request timeout limits

### Performance Optimization

- The scraper now uses `max_pages=3` by default (reduced from original)
- Added 1-second delays between requests to be respectful
- Uses connection pooling and proper headers

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_scraper.py
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /search?q=<query>&max_pages=<number>` - Search for cars

## Response Format

```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "total_count": 10,
  "search_time": 2.5,
  "query": "Toyota"
}
```

## Environment Variables

No special environment variables required. The scraper works with standard Python packages.
