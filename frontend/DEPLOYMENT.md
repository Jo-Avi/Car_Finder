# Frontend Deployment Guide for Render

## Prerequisites
- A Render account (free tier available)
- Your code pushed to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Your Repository
- Ensure all your frontend code is committed and pushed to your Git repository
- The repository should contain the `frontend/` directory with all React files

### 2. Deploy on Render

#### Option A: Using Render Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and sign in
2. Click "New +" and select "Static Site"
3. Connect your Git repository
4. Configure the deployment:
   - **Name**: `car-scraper-frontend` (or your preferred name)
   - **Build Command**: `cd frontend && npm install && npx react-scripts build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `frontend/build`
   - **Environment**: Static Site
5. Click "Create Static Site"

#### Option B: Using render.yaml (Blue-Green Deployment)
1. The `render.yaml` file is already configured
2. In Render dashboard, select "New +" â†’ "Blueprint"
3. Connect your repository
4. Render will automatically detect and use the `render.yaml` configuration

### 3. Environment Variables (if needed)
If your frontend needs to connect to your backend API:
1. In your Render dashboard, go to your static site settings
2. Add environment variables:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Your backend API URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.onrender.com`)

### 4. Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In your static site settings, go to "Custom Domains"
2. Add your domain and configure DNS settings
3. Render will provide the necessary DNS records

### 5. Update API URLs
After deployment, update your frontend code to use the correct backend API URL:
- Replace any hardcoded localhost URLs with your deployed backend URL
- Use environment variables for API URLs

## Post-Deployment
- Your site will be available at `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`
- Render automatically rebuilds and deploys when you push changes to your repository
- Monitor your deployment logs in the Render dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Error
If you get a "Permission denied" error with react-scripts:
- The build command has been updated to use `npx react-scripts build`
- An `.npmrc` file has been added with `unsafe-perm=true`
- A `postinstall` script has been added to fix permissions

### Other Common Issues
- If build fails, check the build logs in Render dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify the build command and publish directory are correct
- Check that your React app builds successfully locally with `npm run build`
- Make sure you're using the correct Node.js version (Render uses 22.16.0 by default)
